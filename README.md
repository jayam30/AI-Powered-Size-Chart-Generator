AI-Powered Size Chart Generator for Apparel Sellers
Overview
With the rapid rise of e-commerce, particularly during the pandemic, one of the biggest challenges for online apparel sellers has been helping customers select the correct size. The issue often results in customers ordering incorrect sizes, leading to returns and increased costs for businesses. This project aims to solve this problem by developing an AI-powered system that generates accurate size charts for apparel sellers, helping customers choose the right fit and ultimately reducing returns and increasing sales.

The Problem
Customers often struggle to find the correct clothing size when shopping online due to variations in sizing across different brands and product types. This can lead to dissatisfaction, increased returns, and higher costs for apparel sellers. The goal of this project is to analyze body measurements, purchase history, and return/exchange data to create a robust AI system that can generate accurate size charts and provide size recommendations.

The Solution
Our AI-powered size chart generator is designed to:

Utilize a comprehensive database of user body measurements (height, weight, bust/chest, waist, hips, etc.).
Analyze previous purchase history and return/exchange data to identify patterns in successful size selections.
Cluster users by body type and their corresponding successful size selections.
Generate size charts for different apparel categories (tops, bottoms, dresses) that accurately map users to sizes like S, M, L, and XL.
Provide confidence scores for each generated size chart, helping sellers and customers make informed decisions.
Allow for easy updates as new purchase and size data becomes available.
Data Source
We are using a dataset from Rent the Runway, which includes:

192,544 rows and 15 features
Body measurements, age, body type, and the sizes users ordered
Insights into what sizes worked for different body types
This dataset allows us to cluster users based on body measurements and generate size recommendations that are personalized for each user.

Model Features
Body Measurement Integration: The model incorporates key body metrics such as height, weight, chest, waist, and hips.
Purchase History Analysis: By analyzing past purchases and returns, the model identifies patterns that lead to accurate size recommendations.
Dynamic Size Chart Generation: The system dynamically generates size charts for various apparel types, providing sellers with precise sizing information.
Confidence Scores: Each size chart comes with confidence scores, indicating the likelihood of accuracy for different body types.
Scalable & Adaptive: The model is scalable, capable of handling new brands or product lines, and adaptable to new data as it becomes available.
Judging Criteria
The model's effectiveness will be evaluated based on:

Accuracy: How closely the generated size charts match known accurate size charts from brands.
Category Handling: The ability to handle a variety of apparel categories.
Return Reduction: Effectiveness in reducing size-related returns, tested using simulated holdout data.
Scalability: Ability to adapt to new brands or product lines without significant modification.
Efficiency: Processing speed and resource efficiency in generating and updating size charts.
Future Work
As the system evolves, we aim to integrate:

Social event recommendations: Suggesting items that fit both the user's body type and social occasions.
Real-time updates: Continuous improvements as new purchase data becomes available.
